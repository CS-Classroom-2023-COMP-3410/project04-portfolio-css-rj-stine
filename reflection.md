Overall I feel okay about this. It was honestly a bit harder but I think it's because I was struggling to figure out how to use the templates for the respinsivness.
Once I got that though it made sense. I really struggled to figure out some design choices though. For whatever reason, some of my fonts wouldn't change even though they did
in the past and I tried a lot and even asked chat a bit for help but eventually gave up on that. In terms of the overall design though, I wanted to keep it mostly the same
which can be seen but I played around with the colors and tried to make it as nice and appealing as possible. I wanted to implement a lot of moving or changing aspects into is as
well which I did. At some point though I got tired and just completed it with what I had but still made sture it looked good.
